I want to write small application using react and supabase( DB as a service).

The UI should be simple and clean.

Here are the features I want in my application:
1. Super admin user.
2. loging/logout functionality.
3. CRUD operations for daily exchange rates.
  USD to MMK with selling and buying rates.
  THB to MMK with selling and buying rates.
  etc.
4. View exchange rate history.
5. Responsive design for mobile and desktop.

You can use dummy exchange rate data for testing purposes.
